# Malayalam Language Support Test Guide

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes
1. **aiService.js**: Added language support to all AI functions
   - `generateChatResponse()` now accepts language parameter
   - `getFallbackResponse()` supports Malayalam translation
   - `generateDiseaseRecommendation()` enforces Malayalam responses
   - `isMalayalam()` function detects Malayalam text
   - `translateToMalayalam()` function provides fallback translation

2. **chat.js (Socket Handler)**: Updated socket handlers
   - `user_message` handler accepts language parameter
   - `plant_image_upload` handler supports language-specific messages
   - Error messages are language-aware

3. **plantDiseaseService.js**: Enhanced disease reporting
   - `formatDiseaseReport()` now supports Malayalam translation
   - Fallback error messages in Malayalam

### Frontend Changes
1. **Chat.tsx**: Language integration
   - Passes current language to socket emissions
   - Both text messages and image uploads include language context

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Malayalam Chat Messages
1. Open the application: http://localhost:5173/
2. Click the language toggle to switch to Malayalam (മലയാളം)
3. Send a farming question in the chat
4. Verify the AI response is in Malayalam

### Test 2: Plant Disease Detection in Malayalam
1. Switch to Malayalam language
2. Upload a plant image using the camera/gallery button
3. Verify all messages (processing, disease report, treatment) are in Malayalam

### Test 3: Fallback Mechanisms
1. The system has multiple fallbacks:
   - If Gemini responds in English when Malayalam is requested, it translates
   - If translation fails, it provides basic Malayalam responses
   - If AI service fails, it uses fallback Malayalam messages

## Language Features

### Translation Support
- Automatic detection of Malayalam text
- Fallback translation using Gemini API
- Basic Malayalam responses when translation fails

### Error Handling
- Language-aware error messages
- Graceful degradation to basic Malayalam
- No backend errors shown to users

### AI Response Quality
- Gemini is instructed to respond in Malayalam when requested
- Translation fallback ensures users always get Malayalam responses
- Context and farming advice remains relevant for Kerala

## Technical Implementation

### Language Threading
- Language parameter flows from frontend → socket → AI service
- All functions in the chain support language parameter
- Consistent language experience throughout the app

### Response Validation
- Checks if Gemini actually responded in Malayalam
- Automatic translation if response is in wrong language
- Multiple fallback layers for reliability

The system now provides a complete Malayalam experience for all AI interactions, including chat responses and plant disease recommendations.
